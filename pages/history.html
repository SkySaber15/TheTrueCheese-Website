    Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheesemaking was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach.

      The earliest evidence of cheese is the Sumerian cuneiform texts of Third Dynasty of Ur, dated at the early second millennium BC. Remains identified as cheese were found in a funeral meal in an Egyptian tomb dating around 2900 BC.Visual evidence of Egyptian cheesemaking was found in Egyptian tomb murals in approximately 2000 BC. The earliest cheeses were sour and salty and similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or present-day feta. An Arab legend attributes the discovery of cheese to an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk. However, cheese was already well-known among the Sumerians. Preserved cheese dating from 1615 BC was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China. In 2018, archeologists from Cairo University and the University of Catania reported the discovery of the oldest known cheese from Egypt. Discovered in the Saqqara necropolis, it is around 3200 years old.
